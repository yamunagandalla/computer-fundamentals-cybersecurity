## 1. What is a Computer?

A computer is an **electronic device** that accepts data as input, processes it into meaningful information, stores it, and outputs it when required.

---

## 2. What is Hardware?

Hardware includes all the **physical components** inside the computer — such as CPU, RAM, hard drive, motherboard, power supply, etc.  
> Cybersecurity link: Attackers may target hardware (like USB ports or firmware).

---

## 3. What is CPU?

The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the "brain" of the computer. It:
- Executes instructions
- Makes decisions
- Runs programs
- Processes data

---

## 4. What is Memory?

**RAM (Random Access Memory)** is:
- Short-term memory
- Volatile (data is lost when power is off)
- Used by CPU to temporarily store data and active programs

---

## 5. What is Hard Drive?

The **hard drive (HDD/SSD)** is the long-term storage:
- Data is saved permanently (non-volatile)
- Composed of platters (in HDD)
- Stores OS, files, apps, and more  
>  Example: In 2023, hard drives reached up to 36TB in size

---

## 6. Networking Basics (Cybersecurity Link)

Computers communicate over networks. Key concepts:
- **IP Address**: Unique ID for a device
- **Router**: Directs traffic between networks
- **Firewall**: Filters harmful traffic
- **Protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP

> Cybersecurity: Understanding ports, packets, and protocols is essential for ethical hacking

---

## 7. File System and Users

- Computers use **file systems** (NTFS, EXT4, etc.) to store and manage data
- **User accounts** can be Admin, Standard, or Guest
- File permissions control who can read/write/execute files

>  Security relevance: Many attacks involve privilege escalation through misconfigured file permissions

---

## 8. Data Representation

- Computers use **binary (0s and 1s)**
- Units: bit, byte, kilobyte, megabyte...
- Conversion between binary, decimal, and hex is useful in cryptography and malware analysis

---

## 9. Security Concepts

- **Authentication**: Verifying identity (e.g., password login)
- **Authorization**: What an authenticated user can do
- **Encryption**: Securing data (e.g., AES, RSA)
- **Firewalls & Antivirus**: Tools to prevent and detect attacks

---

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with these basics, you can start learning:
- [x] Ethical Hacking (TCM / TryHackMe)
- [x] Cryptography
- [x] Linux & Terminal
- [x] Networking tools like Nmap, Wireshark
