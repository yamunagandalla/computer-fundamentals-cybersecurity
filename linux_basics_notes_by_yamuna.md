##  5. What is `.bashrc`?

- `.bashrc` is a **hidden setup file** in your home directory.
- It runs every time you open a new terminal.
- You can add **aliases** (shortcuts) or commands inside it.

###  Example:

```bash
alias hi='echo Hello, Yamuna!'
```

After adding:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Then typing `hi` will show:  
```
Hello, Yamuna!
```
