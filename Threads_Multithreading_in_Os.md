# ðŸ§µ Operating System: Threads for Cybersecurity  

This repository contains **beginner-friendly notes on Threads in Operating Systems**, specially focused on **cybersecurity learners**.  
Threads are crucial to understand because hackers and defenders both use **multithreading** for performance, attacks, and monitoring.

## 1. What is a Thread?  

- A **Process** = a running program (e.g., Browser, Music Player, Code Editor).  
- A **Thread** = the **smallest unit of execution** inside a process.  
- A process can have:  
  - **Single thread** (single-threaded)  
  - **Multiple threads** (multi-threaded)  

ðŸ‘‰ Analogy:  
- **Process = Restaurant**  
- **Threads = Waiters inside the restaurant**  
- One restaurant (process) can have many waiters (threads) serving different tables **at the same time**.

## 2. Thread vs Process  

| Feature           | Process                                   | Thread                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**    | Independent program in execution          | Smallest unit of execution inside a process      |
| **Memory**        | Has its own memory space                  | Shares memory with other threads of same process |
| **Communication** | Harder (IPC required)                     | Easier (shared memory)                           |
| **Crash Impact**  | Crash doesnâ€™t affect other processes      | Crash may stop the whole process                 |
| **Example**       | Chrome browser running                    | Chrome tab loading a webpage                     |

## 3. Real-life Examples  

- **Process Example:** Opening Chrome â†’ creates a process.  
- **Thread Example inside Chrome:**  
  - One thread for rendering the page  
  - One thread for downloading a file  
  - One thread for playing a video  

Another Example:  
- **Process = VS Code**  
- **Threads =** one for UI, one for extensions, one for IntelliSense.

## 4. Why Threads Matter for Hackers  

Hackers use threads to make attacks **faster and parallel**:  

1. **Brute-forcing passwords** â†’ Instead of 1 attempt/sec, use 100 threads = 100 attempts/sec.  
2. **Port scanning** â†’ Threads scan multiple ports at once.  
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)** â†’ Thousands of threads send requests to overload a server.  
4. **Keylogging & Monitoring** â†’ One thread logs keystrokes while another steals files in the background.

## 5. Python Demo: Single vs Multi-threading  

```python
import threading
import time

# Fake password checker
def check_password(password):
    time.sleep(0.5)  # simulate delay
    print(f"Checked password: {password}")

# ---- Single Thread (one by one) ----
def single_thread_demo():
    print("\n--- Single Thread Demo ---")
    start = time.time()
    passwords = ["pass1", "pass2", "pass3", "pass4", "pass5"]
    
    for p in passwords:
        check_password(p)
    
    end = time.time()
    print("Time taken:", round(end - start, 2), "seconds")

# ---- Multi Thread (parallel) ----
def multi_thread_demo():
    print("\n--- Multi Thread Demo ---")
    start = time.time()
    passwords = ["pass1", "pass2", "pass3", "pass4", "pass5"]
    threads = []
    
    for p in passwords:
        t = threading.Thread(target=check_password, args=(p,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    
    end = time.time()
    print("Time taken:", round(end - start, 2), "seconds")

# Run both
single_thread_demo()
multi_thread_demo()

--- Single Thread Demo ---
Checked password: pass1
Checked password: pass2
Checked password: pass3
Checked password: pass4
Checked password: pass5
Time taken: ~2.5 seconds

--- Multi Thread Demo ---
Checked password: pass1
Checked password: pass2
Checked password: pass3
Checked password: pass4
Checked password: pass5
Time taken: ~0.5 seconds

âœ… In Short

Thread = mini-program inside a process
Multithreading = running many threads at once

Hackers use it to:
	-> Speed up brute-force attacks
	-> Scan ports quickly
	-> Overload servers with DoS
	-> Hide background tasks
Next Steps
	->Once comfortable with threads, explore:
	->Multithreading vs Multiprocessing
	->Thread synchronization & race conditions
	->Thread safety in C, Java, Python
	->How malware uses threads to hide in systems
