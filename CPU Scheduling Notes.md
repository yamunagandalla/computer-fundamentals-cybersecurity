## 1. What is CPU Scheduling?  
In an Operating System (OS), many processes often wait to use the CPU.  
The **CPU scheduler** decides which process will run next when multiple processes are ready.  

> This decision affects system performance, including speed, waiting time, and fairness.

---

## 2. Why do we need CPU Scheduling?  
CPU is the most important resource in a system. Without proper scheduling:  
- Some processes may wait forever.  
- CPU may stay idle while processes are waiting.  
- System performance becomes slow and unfair.  

**Benefits of CPU Scheduling:**  
‚úÖ Keep CPU busy  
‚úÖ Reduce waiting time  
‚úÖ Ensure fair allocation to all processes  
‚úÖ Improve response time for users

## 3. When does CPU Scheduling happen? ‚ùó  
CPU scheduling occurs whenever the CPU becomes free. This can happen in situations like:  
- A process switches from **running ‚Üí waiting** (e.g., I/O request).  
- A process **terminates**.  
- A process is **interrupted** (e.g., in Round Robin scheduling).

## 4. Types of CPU Scheduling

### 4.1 Preemptive Scheduling
- OS can **stop a running process** and allocate CPU to another process.  
- Examples: Round Robin, Preemptive Priority, Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)  
- Useful in **real-time systems** and multitasking.

### 4.2 Non-Preemptive Scheduling
- Once a process starts, it **cannot be stopped** until it finishes or waits for I/O.  
- Examples: FCFS, Non-preemptive SJF, Non-preemptive Priority  
- Simpler but **less responsive**.

## 5. CPU Scheduling Algorithms Overview
1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve):** Simplest, like a queue.  
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First):** Prefers shorter processes to reduce waiting time.  
3. **Priority Scheduling:** CPU given based on process priority.  
4. **Round Robin (RR):** Fair sharing with fixed time slices.

## 6. First Come First Serve (FCFS)

- Processes are executed in the **order of arrival**.  
- **Non-preemptive:** Once a process starts, it runs till completion.  

**Example:**

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| P1      | 0                | 5              |
| P2      | 1                | 3              |
| P3      | 2                | 8              |

**Gantt Chart:**  
| P1 | P2 | P3 |
0 5 8 16


**Completion Times (CT):** P1=5, P2=8, P3=16  
**Turnaround Time (TAT = CT - AT):** P1=5, P2=7, P3=14  
**Waiting Time (WT = TAT - BT):** P1=0, P2=4, P3=6  

**Final Table:**

| Process | AT | BT | CT | TAT | WT |
|---------|----|----|----|-----|----|
| P1      | 0  | 5  | 5  | 5   | 0  |
| P2      | 1  | 3  | 8  | 7   | 4  |
| P3      | 2  | 8  | 16 | 14  | 6  |

‚úÖ **Average TAT = 8.67, Average WT = 3.33**

## 7. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling

- Process with **smallest burst time** runs first.  
- Goal: Minimize waiting time.  
- Types:  
  - **Non-preemptive SJF:** Process runs till completion.  
  - **Preemptive SJF (SRTF):** A new shorter process can interrupt the current one.

**Example (Non-preemptive):**

| Process | AT | BT |
|---------|----|----|
| P1      | 0  | 7  |
| P2      | 2  | 4  |
| P3      | 4  | 1  |
| P4      | 5  | 4  |

**Gantt Chart:**  
| P1 | P3 | P2 | P4 |
0 7 8 12 16


**Final Table:**

| Process | AT | BT | CT | TAT | WT |
|---------|----|----|----|-----|----|
| P1      | 0  | 7  | 7  | 7   | 0  |
| P2      | 2  | 4  | 12 | 10  | 6  |
| P3      | 4  | 1  | 8  | 4   | 3  |
| P4      | 5  | 4  | 16 | 11  | 7  |

‚úÖ **Average TAT = 8, Average WT = 4**

## 8. Priority Scheduling

- Each process has a **priority number**; smaller number ‚Üí higher priority.  
- CPU goes to **highest priority process** first.  
- Tie ‚Üí use **FCFS**.  
- Types: Non-preemptive and Preemptive.  
- **Problem:** Starvation of low-priority processes.  
- **Solution:** Aging ‚Üí gradually increase waiting processes‚Äô priority.

**Example (Non-preemptive):**

| Process | AT | BT | Priority |
|---------|----|----|---------|
| P1      | 0  | 5  | 2       |
| P2      | 1  | 3  | 1       |
| P3      | 2  | 8  | 4       |
| P4      | 3  | 6  | 3       |

**Gantt Chart:**  
| P1 | P2 | P4 | P3 |

## 9. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling

- **Fair sharing** CPU scheduling algorithm.  
- Every process gets a **fixed time quantum**.  
- If not finished, process goes to the **back of the queue**.

**Steps:**  
1. Ready processes in a **circular queue**.  
2. Each process runs for **time quantum** or until completion.  
3. If not done ‚Üí goes to end of queue.  
4. Repeat until all processes complete.

**Key Points:**  
- Preemptive  
- Good for **time-sharing systems**  
- **Time quantum** affects performance:  
  - Too small ‚Üí overhead from context switching  
  - Too large ‚Üí behaves like FCFS  

**Example (High-level):**

| Process | BT |
|---------|----|
| P1      | 10 |
| P2      | 4  |
| P3      | 6  |

**Time Quantum = 3**  
**Execution order:**  
P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P1
